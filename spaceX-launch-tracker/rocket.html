                    liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit. Designed to carry small payloads into low Earth orbit, it used
                    a single Merlin engine in its first stage and a Kestrel engine in its second stage, both burning
                    RP-1 and liquid oxygen. Although its first three launches failed, SpaceX succeeded on its fourth
                    attempt in 2008, marking a historic milestone for private spaceflight. Falcon 1 laid the foundation
                    for the company’s later successes with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, proving that reusable,
                    cost-effective rocketry was possible.</p>

                    its first stage can autonomously land on a drone ship or landing pad after launch, drastically
                    lowering costs. It has become the world’s most reliable and frequently launched rocket, used for

                crewed missions beyond Earth orbit. Like Falcon 9, its side boosters are reusable and can land
                simultaneously, creating one of the most spectacular sights in modern rocketry. Falcon Heavy represents
                SpaceX’s push toward deep-space missions and heavy cargo transportation.</p>
