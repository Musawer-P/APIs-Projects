A simple and fun Game Finder App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to search for their favorite games, view matching results, or get a random game suggestion with a single click.

Features:

Search Functionality: Instantly find games by typing their name (e.g., GTA, Fortnite, Minecraft).

Random Game Generator: Feeling indecisive? Press the random button to discover a random game.

Clean UI: Simple and responsive layout with game images sized to look perfect (width: 210px).

Fast Performance: Everything runs on the client side — no frameworks or servers needed.

How It Works:

The app stores a small list of games (each with a title, description, and image).

When the user searches, JavaScript filters and displays games that match the input.

Clicking the Random Game button shows one random game from the list.

Results are dynamically displayed with their images and titles.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 – structure of the page
CSS3 – modern styling and layout
JavaScript (ES6) – logic for searching and random generation
