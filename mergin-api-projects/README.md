Merging API Project

The Merging API Project is a modern web-based application that fetches data from **multiple public APIs**, merges the responses, processes them efficiently, and displays the results in a clean and user-friendly interface. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how different APIs can work together to create a single, meaningful experience for users.

This project focuses on **real-time data fetching**, **API integration**, **data handling**, and **frontend presentation** using standard web technologies.

Features

 Integration of **multiple APIs**
 Merging and processing API responses
 Asynchronous data fetching using JavaScript
 Clean and readable code structure
 Responsive and user-friendly UI
 Error handling for failed API requests

---

Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the application
* **CSS3** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – API handling and logic
* **Fetch API** – Retrieving data from external APIs


---

APIs Used

This project uses multiple public APIs. Each API provides different types of data which are merged and displayed together.

Examples:

* API 1: Provides primary data
* API 2: Provides additional or related data

*(APIs can be easily replaced or extended as needed.)*

---

How It Works

1. The application sends requests to multiple APIs using the Fetch API.
2. Responses are converted to JSON format.
3. Data from different APIs is merged into a single structured object.
4. The merged data is dynamically rendered on the webpage.
5. Errors are handled gracefully if an API fails to respond.

How to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Ensure you have an active internet connection
4. The application will automatically fetch and display the merged API data

---

Error Handling

* Displays user-friendly messages if data fails to load
* Prevents page crashes due to API errors
* Handles network and fetch-related issues

---

Learning Outcomes

* Understanding how to work with multiple APIs
* Managing asynchronous JavaScript operations
* Structuring and merging complex JSON data
* Improving frontend problem-solving skills

---

Future Improvements

* Add loading indicators
* Cache API responses for performance
* Allow users to select APIs dynamically
* Improve UI animations and transitions
